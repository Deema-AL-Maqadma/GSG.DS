🌳 Python Data Structures – SkillStack Paths Training

![Gaza Sky Geeks Logo](GSG_Logo.jpg)

This repository contains the Data Structures (DS) part of the training program  
SkillStack Paths (Fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms part)  
conducted by Gaza Sky Geeks.  
It includes practical implementations and exercises covering core data structures using Python.
